### Build a Chat that responds exclusively IRS related questions.

I am build a Chat that can respond exclusively IRS related questions nothing more nothing less. 

How could I build this using the "OpenAI" API and "Fine Tuning". 

Accourding to the documentation, there are 4 steps to follow: 

1. Prepare your data. ```{
  "messages": [
    { "role": "system", "content": "You are an assistant that occasionally misspells words" },
    { "role": "user", "content": "Tell me a story." },
    { "role": "assistant", "content": "One day a student went to schoool." }
  ]
}```

What does each of these roles mean and for this use case(IRS Questions) what could an example?

Could for "user" role be something like this?

```
{ "role": "user", "content": 
"
My client is single, currently employed by Company A
as well as consulting contract for Company C.

Bought X amount of stocks at Company D at price Y and
sold such Company C stock the same year for Z price.

X dollars where collected through saving accounts interest.

Company stock F distributed X dollars in dividends.

Client is shareholder of a s-corporation and c-corporation
that had a net income and distributed dividends.

Client owns a few properties that are currently
rented through a property manager.

Some of the propertities had an amortization and depreciation.

One of the properties is under a mortgage
with around 5% interest rate.

Earlier this year one of the properties suffered damages from a
natural disaster and had to do repairs, purchase new
furnitures and appliances.

What forms do I need to file, receive, attach etc etc?

" }

```

2. Upload files
```
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/files \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -F "purpose=fine-tune" \
  -F "file=@path_to_your_file" 
  ```

What if I need to upload 2000k PDF files that will be convert to .txt files though a lot of them exceed the amount of tokens. 

Does it have to one file at the time? 

3. Create a fine-tuning job

curl https://api.openai.com/v1/fine_tuning/jobs \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
-d '{
  "training_file": "TRAINING_FILE_ID",
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613"
}'

Where do I getn the "training_file": "TRAINING_FILE_ID" ?

4. Use a fine-tuned model.

```curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
-d '{
  "model": "ft:gpt-3.5-turbo:org_id",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are an assistant that occasionally misspells words"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Hello! What is fine-tuning?"
    }
  ]
}'
```

For our use case what would be an example of the

```    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Hello! What is fine-tuning?"
    }
```

### GPT
Building a chat system focused exclusively on IRS-related questions using the OpenAI API and fine-tuning is an extensive process, and the details below provide a general overview. However, you should refer to OpenAI's official documentation for the most accurate and current information.

- Step 1: Prepare Your Data
Roles in the training data represent the different participants in the conversation. In your case:

System: Provides initial instructions to the AI, for instance: "You are an assistant specializing in IRS-related questions."
User: The user’s inputs. This would be specific questions or queries regarding IRS matters, like your example.
Assistant: The assistant’s responses. These should be accurate answers to the IRS-related questions posed by the user.
Example data snippet:

``````
{
  "messages": [
    { "role": "system", "content": "You are an assistant specializing in IRS-related questions." },
    { "role": "user", "content": "What forms do I need to file if I have income from various sources?" },
    { "role": "assistant", "content": "You might need to file Form 1040, Schedule C, Schedule E, and potentially others based on your specific circumstances. Refer to IRS guidelines or consult a tax professional for advice tailored to your situation." }
  ]
}```

- Step 2: Upload Files
For uploading large datasets or splitting large text files into smaller chunks, you might have to create a script or process to handle this. Each file you upload should comply with OpenAI’s token and file size limits. You might need to preprocess and clean your PDF data, converting it into a text-based format that adheres to these constraints.

- Step 3: Create a Fine-Tuning Job
"training_file": "TRAINING_FILE_ID" refers to the ID of the file you uploaded in step 2. When you upload a file using the OpenAI API, you will receive a file ID as part of the response. Use this ID when creating a fine-tuning job.

- Step 4: Use a Fine-Tuned Model
For your use case, the "content" field under the "user" role would contain IRS-related questions that users of your system might ask. An example is:

```{
  "role": "user",
  "content": "Can I claim deductions on home office expenses if I'm self-employed?"
}``````

Ensure to replace the "model" field with the ID of your fine-tuned model when making requests to the API.

### Conclusion
Remember to handle user data with care, respecting privacy laws and guidelines. Since you are dealing with sensitive tax information, it is crucial to secure and protect user data adequately.

The actual implementation might vary based on the specific requirements and constraints of your project, and you should refer to the most current OpenAI API documentation and seek advice from professionals as needed.

### User
ok so after all step from 1 to 3, I can use the fine tuned model with my organization's ID that would enable me to get get anwsers from you that are limited to IRS context only?

### ChatGPT
Yes, after successfully completing steps 1 to 3, you should have a fine-tuned model that specializes in IRS-related questions. When using this model, it would provide responses based on the training and fine-tuning data it was trained on, focusing specifically on the IRS context you've provided.

However, always keep the following points in mind:

Accuracy and Reliability: No model is perfect, and you should always validate the accuracy and reliability of the responses it generates. For critical or ambiguous queries, referring users to official IRS publications or advising them to consult a tax professional is prudent.

Security and Privacy: Handling tax information requires stringent privacy and security measures. Ensure you have protocols in place to protect user data and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

Continuous Improvement: Tax laws and IRS policies change, and new situations arise. Regularly update and retrain your model to maintain its accuracy and relevance over time.

For the actual implementation and usage of the model, you'll need to refer to the official OpenAI documentation and possibly seek assistance from professionals or experts in the field of machine learning and AI to ensure the proper deployment and operation of your fine-tuned model.

Remember that even with fine-tuning, AI is not infallible, and the responsibility for the accuracy and applicability of its responses ultimately rests with you and your organization.

### User
Now for example if I ask a not related question will OpenAI API respond to such unrelated question or would it say something like "My model is not meant to anwser questions that not related to the IRS" ?

### ChatGPT
When you fine-tune a model, it becomes biased towards the domain-specific data it was trained on. However, it doesn't inherently block or prevent responses to off-topic questions. Instead, it might answer off-topic questions less effectively, or its responses might still somewhat lean towards the domain it was fine-tuned for.

If you need the model to explicitly refuse or not answer questions that are not related to IRS matters, you might need to implement a layer of logic or filtering in your application that uses the AI. This layer would analyze the AI’s responses (and possibly the user’s inputs) to determine whether or not they are on-topic, and then decide how to act accordingly.

For example, you might have the application check whether the AI’s response (or the user’s question) contains specific keywords, phrases, or other indicators that it is related to tax or IRS matters. If not, the application could suppress the AI’s response and instead return a standardized message indicating that the question is off-topic or outside the AI’s area of expertise.

Implementing this sort of logic can help you ensure that users only receive information and assistance that is within the AI’s designated specialty and that you have validated as accurate and reliable.

### User
Ok so this means that in order to block off-topic questions this will have to be programmed on the applcation side rather than of the fine-tuning side?

### ChatGPT
Correct! The fine-tuning process primarily helps the model become more specialized or accurate within a specific domain, but it does not inherently enable the model to recognize or block off-topic questions. To manage or block off-topic questions, you would need to implement additional logic or filtering mechanisms within the application or system that is interfacing with the AI model.

This additional layer would be responsible for analyzing both user inputs and AI outputs to ensure they are relevant to IRS-related matters. For example, you could develop a system that checks for specific keywords, phrases, or topics related to taxes and IRS in the user's query and the AI's response. If the system does not detect these elements, it could then return a standardized message to the user indicating that the query is off-topic and cannot be answered.

Keep in mind that designing and implementing such a system may require careful planning and testing to ensure it accurately identifies and manages off-topic questions without blocking or misinterpreting valid queries related to IRS matters. Always consider consulting with professionals or experts in the field to guide you in building a robust and effective solution.

### User
Is there a way to block off-topic questions and answers?

### ChatGPT
Blocking off-topic questions and answers efficiently requires a combination of AI fine-tuning and additional logic within your application.

1. AI Fine-Tuning:
Fine-tuning helps the model specialize in a particular domain. The model would likely be better at generating relevant responses but doesn't inherently block off-topic content.

2. Application-Level Filtering:
You can develop a mechanism in your application to filter out off-topic questions and answers. Here's a simplified approach:

For User Input:

Keyword Matching: Create a list of IRS or tax-related keywords and phrases. Check if the user's input contains these.

Topic Modeling: Use NLP techniques to determine the topic of the user’s input, allowing or blocking queries based on their relevance to IRS matters.

For AI Output:
Response Analysis: Analyze the AI’s output for relevance and accuracy. You might use keyword matching, topic modeling, or other NLP techniques to assess the response's relevance to IRS or tax matters.
Confidence Threshold: If possible, use the AI's confidence score (if available) for its responses. Set a threshold below which responses are considered unreliable or off-topic.

Example Workflow:
User submits a question.
Application analyzes the question for relevance to IRS or tax matters.
If relevant, the question is forwarded to the AI.
AI generates a response.
Application analyzes the AI’s response for relevance and accuracy.
If the response is deemed relevant and accurate, it is sent to the user; otherwise, the user receives a message indicating that their question is off-topic.

#### Challenges and Considerations:

Complexity: Developing accurate filtering mechanisms can be complex and time-consuming.
- False Positives/Negatives: No filter is perfect. There might be valid queries blocked or irrelevant queries allowed.

- Maintenance: The filtering mechanism needs regular updates and maintenance to adapt to changes in language use, tax law, and user behavior.

##### Recommendation:
Develop a prototype and iteratively improve it based on real-world usage and feedback. Conduct thorough testing to minimize false positives and negatives, and consider working with experts in tax law, NLP, and AI to create an effective and reliable system.

Remember to handle user data with the utmost care, complying with all applicable privacy laws and regulations, given the sensitive nature of tax-related information.
