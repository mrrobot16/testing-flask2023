# IRS Copilot Core Development Guidelines

Guidelines for the core development contributors on the IRS Copilot API written to have a better understanding of IRS Copilot progress and coordination. Recommended read for new developers as part of onboarding.

### Issues management

All planned features, bugs, and enhancements are represented as a Github issue with appropriate description, examples, and issue labels.

Once created, issues can be brought into the [repository's "project"](https://github.com/orgs/XXX/projects/2), an automated kanban board consisting of columns that mark the issue status and can be _Unassigned_, _Assigned_, _In progress_ and _Done_. _Backlog_ column is used for keeping the available issues that are up for grabs and also when creating new tasks such as features, bug fixes or ideas.

Milestones in the Github projects are oriented to specific goals such as releases (bigger or smaller) as the progress can be measured for an estimate of time left until release.
